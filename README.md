DiscordBotNumbot
My Discord bot, an exercise in learning node js 

NOTE: The code you see anywhere in a config.json is out of date and wont be usable, only I have the code for my token 

Plans for the bot (right now) : 

- Create a scheduler 
    - Will be in c. Use Libmicrohttpd so that the JS file can connect and send information to util.c
    - Util.c will update and store the information needed by the scheduler commands 
    - Need to: (1) Implement a schedule (2) Implement Libmicrohttpd (3) Allow index.js to communicate with util.c 
    Finish (1) By 10/8 
    Finish (2) By 10/15
