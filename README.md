DiscordBotNumbot
My Discord bot, an exercise in learning node js 

NOTE: The code you see anywhere in a config.json is out of date and wont be usable, only I have the code for my token 

Plans for the bot (right now) : 

- Write backend code in python
- explore libraries that can make api calls
- make api call and print that data
